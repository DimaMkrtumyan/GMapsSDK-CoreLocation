# GMapsSDK-CoreLocation
In this project i have added another test of GoogleMaps and CoreLocation, for commercial project. 

Projects details: 
- Test project's idea: it is a google's standard guide idea -> get user's current location and by tapping the Places button display 5 Most Liked places (around user's current location)
- Architecture: MVP
- App's structure: the app consists of two pages -> MapViewController and PlacesViewController

The test includes following tasks:
1) User's current location updates in Background mode
2) Battery save code style as far as possible for step-by-step navigation
3) adhere to the SOLID principles
4) Include tests (the main reason why i used here MVP architecture)
